The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern
that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects
without specifying their concrete classes,
in simpler terms the Abstract Factory Pattern
is a way of organizing how you create groups of things that are related to each other.


Abstract Factory example
Imagine youâ€™re managing a global car manufacturing company.
You want to design a system to create cars with specific configurations for different regions,
such as North America and Europe.
Each region may have unique requirements and regulations,
and you want to ensure that cars produced for each region meet those standards.

What can be the challenges while implementing this system?

One challenge can be designing cars with specific features and configurations for different regions.

The other main challenge is to ensure consistency in the production of cars
and their specifications within each region.
Adapting the system to changes in regulations or
introducing new features for a specific region becomes challenging.
Modifications would need to be made in multiple places,
increasing the chances of introducing bugs and making the system more prone to errors.
