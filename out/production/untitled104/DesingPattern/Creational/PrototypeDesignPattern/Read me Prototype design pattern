Suppose a user creates a document with a specific layout, fonts, and styling,
and wishes to crea  te similar documents with slight modifications.

Instead of starting from scratch each time,
the user can use the Prototype pattern.
The original document becomes the prototype, and new documents are created by cloning this prototype. This approach ensures that the new documents inherit the structure and styling of the original document while allowing for customization.
